<p>WordPress is an effective platform for powering large web sites with various types of content and structured data. In this case study, Randy Hoyt will share from his experience developing a network of shopping center web sites on WordPress for a large property management company. He will explore the newer WordPress 3.x features, its child theme architecture, custom plugins, caching techniques, and cloud hosting infrastructure used to extend and scale WordPress for this project.</p>
